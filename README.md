# Progressively-Harder

Make the game progressively harder by removing most used upgrades

# In Details
When the game starts (or when a victory is acquired), the game will take a random integer from 90 (by default) to 100. The mod will take a "picture" of all towers on the field at the given round. When the game will end as a victory, the mod will analyse the picture, detect which tower was the strongest (highest number of pops) and add a restriction on the highest tier of the tower. 

For example, if the best tower is a 025 Tack, it will put a restriction on the tack shooter of xx5. Restrictions can be reset and load (if you want to make a fun challenge for someone).


Note:
I didn't tried with heroes nor paragons. Paragons should work fine but I'm not sure about heroes
